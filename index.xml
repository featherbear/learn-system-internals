This speed refers to the rate (in Hz) at which the processor is able to generate pulses - that are used to synchronise its operations.
i.e. an Arduino (i.e. ATmega 328) operates at 16 MHz.
i.e. A Ryzen 9 3900X CPU operates at 3.8 GHz.
Execution In the CPU, there exists a Pointer Register known as the &amp;ldquo;program counter&amp;rdquo; (PC), which keeps track of the next instruction the processor should execute.</description></item><item><title>Compilers</title><link>/cpu-fundamentals/compilers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:13:55 +1000</pubDate><guid>/cpu-fundamentals/compilers/</guid><description>The Language of the CPU As with all digital circuitry logic - the CPU only understands binary instructions.
We call these instructions &amp;ldquo;machine code&amp;rdquo;.
Machine code instructions are specific to the CPU architecture (Intel x86, amd64, MIPS, AVR, etc&amp;hellip;) and will only work for its intended architecture.
Modern day programming languages often have features like variables, macros and switch statements.
Whilst easy to understand by us humans, the computer itself won&amp;rsquo;t understand these things - which is why we have compilers.</description></item><item><title>Memory</title><link>/cpu-fundamentals/memory/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:13:33 +1000</pubDate><guid>/cpu-fundamentals/memory/</guid><description>Memory Everything is Memory When we save a file, it is saved to the computer memory.
When we perform an arithmetic operation, its operands and outputs are stored in the memory
When we press a key, a flag in the memory is changed.
When we launch a program, that program is loaded into memory!
Representation of Data As digital circuits (i.e. computers) only deal with binary data (1s and 0s) - there exists different encoding schemas to represent different data types.</description></item><item><title>The CPU</title><link>/cpu-fundamentals/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:12:54 +1000</pubDate><guid>/cpu-fundamentals/overview/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a CPU? Inside a CPU is a group of different microchips that collectively work together to serve the functionality of a CPU.
I/O To interact with other devices on the system, the CPU contains input and output lanes which are physically connected (via &amp;lsquo;busses&amp;rsquo; on the circuit board) to those devices.
I/O can include keyboards, mice, monitors, speakers.
Registers Registers are data storages that lie in the CPU.</description></item><item><title>Course Outline</title><link>/course-outline/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 12:38:30 +1000</pubDate><guid>/course-outline/</guid><description> System Internals Overview This course delves into the underlying low-level hardware components and software algorithms that form the base primitive components used in modern computing
