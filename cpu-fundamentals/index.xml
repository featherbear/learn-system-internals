When we perform an arithmetic operation, its operands and outputs are stored in the memory
When we press a key, a flag in the memory is changed.
When we launch a program, that program is loaded into memory!
Representation of Data As digital circuits (i.e. computers) only deal with binary data (1s and 0s) - there exists different encoding schemas to represent different data types.</description></item><item><title>The CPU</title><link>/cpu-fundamentals/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 13:12:54 +1000</pubDate><guid>/cpu-fundamentals/overview/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s in a CPU? Inside a CPU is a group of different microchips that collectively work together to serve the functionality of a CPU.
I/O To interact with other devices on the system, the CPU contains input and output lanes which are physically connected (via &amp;lsquo;busses&amp;rsquo; on the circuit board) to those devices.
I/O can include keyboards, mice, monitors, speakers.
Registers Registers are data storages that lie in the CPU.</description></item></channel></rss>
